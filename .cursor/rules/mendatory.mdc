## Point 1 - Before Creating Porject
1. Before Creating a Project ALWAYS AND MUST do the following
- Remember user to create Virtual enviroment when doing python project python -m venv venv
- For Node projects Create node modules, package.json, package.json-lock by first do -> npm init -y.
- For Laravel Download Herd from herd.laravel.com for macOS or Windows. Verify installation by: 
    php --version
    composer --version
    laravel --version

- Create .env file in every stack 
- Create .gitgnore file in every project and stack must add these below into .gitignore file:
    venv
    .venv
    node_modules/
    .env
    server/.env
    client/.env
    client/build/
    *.log

- ALWAYS create Requirements.txt file after installing dependencies pip > freeze requirements.txt
- Create a readme file, The structure of the file will be:

  - Python virtual environment version using

  - How to start and run the project

## Point 2 - Clarify yourself and user
2. If user's mind is not clear in requirement then it is your DUTY to First understand what user's needs fully For example if user says "I want a login/signup page, then you don't have to give him code right away first you need to ask these questions

- In which language you need your login/signup page (Python, laravel, node)

- What feilds do you need? 

- Do you need proper validation and verification?

- Always be at the right track do not give extra files or complicate things. 

- If the project is small use the monolithic approach BUT if the projet is large, important and complex use microservices approach according to its stack.

# Note: Only then you have to start working on the project and make sure in every project you create above file mentioned in point 1
